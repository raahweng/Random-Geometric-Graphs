Master's Thesis on **Tr[L+] as a Percolation Signature for Random Geometric Graphs** under the supervision of Dr. Gunnar Pruessner and Emir Sezik.

*Random Geometric Graphs (RGGs) model spatially embedded networks, where edges form
 based on proximity of nodes. In the thermodynamic limit, as the connection radius increases,
 RGGs exhibit a percolation transition from disconnected clusters to a giant connected compo
nent. Although this phenomenon has been studied in probability theory, no existing work has
 identified a signature of the percolation transition in the spectral statistics of the graph Lapla
cian, which belongs to an ensemble of Euclidean Random Matrices. This thesis addresses this
 gap by introducing a principled extension of the Kirchhoff index, a graph invariant based on
 effective resistance, to disconnected graphs. We demonstrate that this observable diverges at
 the percolation transition, and extract critical parameters from its finite-size scaling, matching
 knownvalues. We then use tools from Random Matrix Theory to derive an analytical expression
 of its ensemble average, formulate a motif expansion for the spectral density of sparse RGGs,
 and investigate crossover behaviour in the soft kernel case.*
